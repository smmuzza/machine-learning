    "Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported."

    "- `'RM'` is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "* Would you expect a home that has an `'RM'` value(number of rooms) of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an `'RM'` value of 7?\n",
    "* Would you expect a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value(percent of lower class workers) of 15 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value of 20?\n",
    "* Would you expect a neighborhood that has an `'PTRATIO'` value(ratio of students to teachers) of 10 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an `'PTRATIO'` value of 15?"

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "RM: The average number of rooms in the neighborhood should indicate a higher value of the home, since it is more likely to be a house. Furthermore, a house with many rooms is more likely to be expensive, as each room to rent is worth real market value. As a ballpark, one would expect each room, especially bedrooms (which I we don't have data labels on specifically), to add something like 30% to the value of the house. So in short, it will increase the value, but be how much depends on the definition of room and how said rooms are labelled in the data set. Higher RM should correlate with higher home prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTAT: Economically the more poor, the lower the value of the real estate, as the poor simply cannot afford to live there. One likely exception to this can be certain areas where a particular percentage of the housing is labelled affordable housing. In areas with affordable housing, there may be a legally mandated percentage of lower class workers living there cheaply on subsidised housing, and therefore the statistics in these areas may be misleading, as the value of the property may be high though the tentent is there on under-market rate rents. In such situations the LSAT may not be as an effective a predictor as it is in other areas. In general, low LSTAT should indicate higther median home prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "PTRATIO: I am assuming that this is referring to parent to teach ratios at public schools. These are a fairly good indicator of wealth, as richer school districts can afford to have more teachs per student, which is desirable as it is strongly correlated to things like children's grades and admission to top universities. As such, a lower RTRATIO should yield higher median home prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below plots (median home price on x axis) show roughly linear trend lines for PTRATIO and RM, though PTRATIO has a large variance and some outliers to the trend. LSTAT seems to be bi-modal, made up of roughly 2 primary distributions, one above 600k, and one below 600k median price.\n",

    "### Implementation: Define a Performance Metric\n",
    "It is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement. For this project, you will be calculating the [*coefficient of determination*](http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=coefficient_of_determination), R<sup>2</sup>, to quantify your model's performance. The coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in regression analysis, as it often describes how \"good\" that model is at making predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The values for R<sup>2</sup> range from 0 to 1, which captures the percentage of squared correlation between the predicted and actual values of the **target variable**. A model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0 is no better than a model that always predicts the *mean* of the target variable, whereas a model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",
    "\n",

    "Overfitting describes a model that fits perfectly to examples it has seen, but fits poorly to examples it has never seen before. This was a big problem in the early days of Neural Networks, before techniques like regularization, and test-train splits, were common place. These overfitted neural networks were seen as \"brittle\", and made experts pessimistic about their prospects. \n",
    "\n",
    "To limit the chance of overfit, we want to, among other things, have a special section of data that is never used for training. This is called a test set. Since the model has never seen this data before, if it can work well on the test set then it is a strong indication that we have a good model that is well trained. As such, performance against the test set it used to ensure we have not overfitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting is usually the result of having not enough data to train the appropriate model (hence the advantage of things like data augmentation), or that the model is too simple, too complex (such as fitting a high order polynomial to a linear funtion), or in-appropriate in others ways so that it cannot well shape or fit itself to the data provided. Therefore, the model will not perform well even on the training set on which is has attempted to learn.\n",

Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*.
