    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive bayes performs well when the features can be considered independent. Since this is a Gaussian variant, it will perform well when the underlying data can be approximated (well-fitted to) by a Gaussian distribution. This model can also be used in the closed form expression as a maximum liklihood and expectation maximization estimators, such as in Gaussian Mixture Models, Kalman Filters, and their variants.\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm\n",

    "If these independence and Guassian assumptions are true, then the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier can be both accurate and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive bayes performs poorly when the feautres are no considered independent. Gaussian Naive Bayes will further perform poorly when the data is not distributed in a Gaussian-like manner, since the distribution will not fit the data well. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it is difficult to say at first glance whether thes independence and Guassian (true for many natural systems) assumptions are true or not for things like education levels, capital gain, hours per week, race, and country of origin. If the model performs poorly, it may be an indication that the features are correlated and non-Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these assumptions are not correct, then this may not be a good model.\n",

    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree can make decisions that maximise information gain, a decrease in entropy. In this way it is easy to understand, as one can directly calculate what amount of knowledge is being learned at each step based on what decisions. It can also make decisions with a limited amount of hard data, like in an online genie https://en.akinator.com/.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be good for breaking up features into lots of small trees to combine later in an ensemble method, like a random forest. It is also, like Naive Bayes, a relatively lightweight classifcation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "Can often be unstable. Because they rely on a small number of decisions, a small change in the input can lead to a drastic change in the output. Again, this can be seen in the Akinator, where a change in a single question can yield a dramatically different answer on what person is being thought of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the weakness of the tree can be mitigated by a random forest, which is essentially lots of randomly generated small trees combining there decisions. This does lose some of the benefits of simple interpretability found in a single tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "As this model does not have a strong underlying Gaussian or indepedence assumption, it may perform better than Naive Bayes. One can imagine that the question style structure of a census may map itself well to the decision branching structure of a decision tree. For example, it seems natural to assume university level education as a good question to ask where a human try to predict whether a person did or did not earn over 50k. \n",

    "Because of techniques like the kernel trick, SVMs are able to be trained on and classify multi-dimensional data and map them to even higher dimensions. \n",

    "We are decided to use a Random Forest (2) model for prediction of income levels of the census data. This model is relatively quick, has good performance of training and test data, and is resistant to overfitting to training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest works similar to a decision tree (1), but is a \"forest\" of such trees. A single decision tree is constructed by breaking data down at a series of decending forking nodes. The full data set is at the top of the tree, and the data broken down by forking questions into smaller and smaller data sets, like tree roots or branches, with the final level of each fork providing the final decision of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees, especially deep ones with many levels of decisions, have a tendency to overfit. This means that they hug the training data too tightly and do poorly on test data that they have not seen before. By constructing a series of random trees and combining their results into a \"random forest\", we can mitigate the downsides of a decision tree and produce more robust predictive performance on new data that has not been used in training. \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

It would be good to try and find the best trade-off here. I have included the top 7 features for an example, which only has above a 1.7% penalty to F-score, while still being quite fast.\n",

    "The speed upgrade might be quite nice in that it would allow a more exhaustive grid search on the reduced feature list. It is possible that, if forced to choose between a more extensive grid search and more features, that a better grid search may end up improving performance more than the additional features."
